# IST Lab 02 : LOGICAL VOLUMES AND SNAPSHOTS

Authors : Butty Vicky & MÃ¼hlemann Julien

Group : L01GrA

Date : 07.03.2024

## TASK 1: CREATE PHYSICAL VOLUMES

1. > Reset your external disk. Using `parted` remove all partitions, or simply write a new partition table.

```bash
$ sudo parted /dev/sdb
$ mktable
msdos


2. > Create four partitions with these characteristics: primary, 25 MB size, type `ext4`.

```bash
$ mkpart primary 0 50 ext4
quit
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 ../dev/sdbn .../dev/sdb4 
```
   

3. > List the available LVM commands. They belong to the Debian package *lvm2* which should already be installed. Use `dpkg` with the `-L` option to list the content of the package. The commands are all located in the `/sbin` directory. Use `grep` to filter and `sort` to sort alphabetically.

The command typed is as follows:
```bash
$ sudo dpkg -L lvm2 | grep /sbin/
/sbin/fsadm
/sbin/lvm
/sbin/lvmdump
/sbin/lvmpolld
/sbin/lvchange
/sbin/lvconvert
/sbin/lvcreate
/sbin/lvdisplay
/sbin/lvextend
/sbin/lvmconfig
/sbin/lvmdiskscan
/sbin/lvmsadc
/sbin/lvmsar
/sbin/lvreduce
/sbin/lvremove
/sbin/lvrename
/sbin/lvresize
/sbin/lvs
/sbin/lvscan
/sbin/pvchange
/sbin/pvck
/sbin/pvcreate
/sbin/pvdisplay
/sbin/pvmove
/sbin/pvremove
/sbin/pvresize
/sbin/pvs
/sbin/pvscan
/sbin/vgcfgbackup
/sbin/vgcfgrestore
/sbin/vgchange
/sbin/vgck
/sbin/vgconvert
/sbin/vgcreate
/sbin/vgdisplay
/sbin/vgexport
/sbin/vgextend
/sbin/vgimport
/sbin/vgimportclone
/sbin/vgmerge
/sbin/vgmknodes
/sbin/vgreduce
/sbin/vgremove
/sbin/vgrename
/sbin/vgs
/sbin/vgscan
/sbin/vgsplit
```

4. > List all partitions that could potentially host a Physical Volume by using `pvs` with the `--all` option.

   

   

5. > On the four partitions of your external disk, create four Physical Volumes using `pvcreate`. Add the `-vv` option so that it tells you in detail what it is doing. For the first partition copy the output of the command into the report, but copy only the lines about the partition that receives the Physical Volume and ignore the other messages.

   

   

6. > Display detailed information about the first Physical Volume using `pvdisplay`.

   

   

   

## TASK 2: CREATE TWO VOLUME GROUPS

1. > Create a first Volume Group `lab-vg1` that contains only the first Physical Volume. Display the Physical Volume again with `pvdisplay`. What has changed?

   

   

2. > Create a second Volume Group `lab-vg2` that contains Physical Volumes 2 and 3.

   

   

3. > List all Volume Groups with `vgs`. Then list all Physical Volumes with `pvs`. What do you see?

   

   

   

## TASK 3: CREATE LOGICAL VOLUMES

1. > On the Volume Group `lab-vg1` create a Logical Volume of size 20 MB with the command `lvcreate -L 20M lab-vg1`.

   

   

2. > Verify hat the new volume appears when you use `lvs` to list Logical Volumes. Also verify that it appears when you use `lsblk` to list the block devices. What is the name of the special file in `/dev` that represents the volume?

   

   

3. > Create an ext4 file system on the volume. Mount the volume. Fill the file system with a 14 MB file using `dd` (Google it).

   

   

4. > On the Volume Group `lab-vg2` create another Logical Volume of size 20 MB, create an ext4 file system on it and mount it. Create a file named `foo` that contains the text `111`.

   

   

   

## TASK 4: GROW A FILE SYSTEM WHILE IT IS IN USE

1. > Verify that the file system is indeed full (use `df -h`).

   

   

2. > Verify that the Volume Group is full (use `vgs`).

   

   

3. > Extend the Volume group using `vgextend` and verify with `vgs`.

   

   

4. > Extend the Logical Volume by an additional 20 MB using `lvextend --size <new_size> <volume_group>/<logical_volume>`.

   

   

5. > Grow the file system while it is mounted using `resize2fs` and verify its new capacity with `df -h`. Note: not all file systems support growing while being mounted. In that case you have to stop all applications using the file system, unmount, grow, remount, and restart the applications.

   

   

   

## TASK 5: CREATE A SNAPSHOT

1. > Create a snapshot volume using the `--snapshot` option of `lvcreate`. Use the `--name` option to give it the name `snap`. You also need to specify a size for the snapshot with the `--size` option. Remember that initially a snapshot does not consume any storage blocks as the data in the original volume and the snapshot volume is identical. It is only when the data in the two volumes starts deviating that storage blocks are needed. The size of the snapshot determines how many data blocks can be different.
   >
   > To make things interesting, specify a size less than the size of the original volume.
   >
   > Note that LVM snapshots are read/write by default.

   

   

2. > Display an overview of all Logical Volumes using `lvs`. Which column shows the name of the original volume?

   

   

3. > Display the charactersticts of the snapshot volume using `lvdisplay`.
   >
   > - What line shows the name of the original volume?
   > - What line shows the size of the original volume?
   > - What line shows the space allocated for the snapshot volume?
   > - What does COW stand for?

   

   

4. > Mount the snapshot volume. Using the file `foo` you created earlier verify that the two volumes behave like independent copies.

   

   

5. > Make the data of the original volume change completely by using the `dd` command to write a new file of 14 MB size. Run `df -h` to see how it affects the fullness of the original volume and the snapshot. What do you see?

   

   

   - > The way that you allocated it, is the snapshot volume able support a change of 14 MB of data?

     

     

   - > What happened? Why?

     

     

6. > Remove the broken snapshot volume.

   

   

7. > Redo the above, this time allocating sufficient space to the snapshot volume to support a complete change of data of the original volume.

   

   

### TASK 6: PROVISION A THIN VOLUME AND SNAPSHOT IT

1. > Remove all Logical Volumes from Volume Group `lab-vg2`.

   

   

2. > Follow the explanations in the Ubuntu manual on [lvmthin](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man7/lvmthin.7.html) to create
   >
   > - a thin data Logical Volume called `pool0` of 28 MB
   > - a thin metadata Logical Volume called `pool0meta` of 4 MB

   

   

3. > Combine the two into a thin pool Logical Volume. List the Logical Volumes using `lvs`. Use the `-a` option to list also the hidden ones.

   

   

4. > Create a thin Logical Volume from the thin pool named `thin1` and give it a size of 80 MB, although the thin pool only has 28 MB capacity. What warnings to you see?

   

   

5. > Create an ext4 file system on `thin1`. Mount the file system. How much capacity does `df -h` see in the file system?

   

   

6. > Do experiments: Fill the file system with a bit of data by using `dd` to write files and verify that it behaves normally. Then write more and more data until you cross the size of the thin pool and see what happens. You can see LVM's log messages by using the `dmesg` command, they appear as `device-mapper`. What do you observe?

   

   



### TASK 7: SCENARIO

> You are a data engineer in a company. You need to set up the backup system for your production system, which runs a large database. Backups are important in case of unexpected incidents or human error. As the volume of data is significant, the backup process's duration can be fairly long, typically between 30 minutes and 1 hour.
>
> Designing a solution for this backup system using snapshots, knowing that:
>
> - The backup should be performed without interrupting the database operations.
>
> - The backup files need to be physically distant and sent to another datacenter located a few kilometers away.
>
> Describe a potential solution and explain your thought process.
